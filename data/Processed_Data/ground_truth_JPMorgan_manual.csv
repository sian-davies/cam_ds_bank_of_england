JPMorganChase_3Q24_A_28.0,A,28,"No. Those were core NII or NII ex.. So again, reiterating at the time, the 2024 consensus was $91.5 billion. The 2025 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex. Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer albeit maybe still a little bit toppy.",Negative,Earnings,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q24_Q_26.0,Q,62,"Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment? And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And, again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.",Neutral,Financials,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q24_A_26.0,A,62,"Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.",Positive,Financials,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q24_Q_30.0,Q,97,"Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?",Neutral,M&A | Investments,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q24_A_30.0,A,97,"Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here.",Positive,M&A | Investments,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q24_Q_33.0,Q,100,"As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question.",Neutral,M&A | Investments,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q24_A_33.0,A,100,"Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that.",Negative,General News | Opinion,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q23_Q_30.0,Q,131,"Just to make sure I understood what you're saying, so you have NII ex. Markets going from $94 billion to $88 billion. Within that, would the contribution from First Republic be down as well or up?",Neutral,Earnings,Evasive,,,,,,,

JPMorganChase_4Q23_A_30.1,A,131,"Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then, you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then this is like too complicated. So, I'd rather not go there.",Negative,Earnings,,,,,,,,

JPMorganChase_3Q23_Q_19.0,Q,151,"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?",Positive,Earnings,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q23_A_19.0,A,151,"Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.",Positive,Earnings,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q23_Q_20.0,Q,188,"Got it. And just a follow-up on the upcoming Basel reforms, two questions. You've talked about the impact to the U.S. economy, like others have said the same.

Thank you.",Neutral,Legal | Regulation,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q23_A_20.0,A,188,"Yeah. So on your first point, I mean, I think you can just read Vice Chair Barr's speech, right?",Neutral,Fed | Central Banks,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q23_Q_23.0,Q,191,"Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed?",Negative,Fed | Central Banks,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q23_A_23.1,A,191,"Wait. Before Jeremy answers the question, this is great news for hedge funds, private equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackstone – and they’re dancing in the streets.",Negative,M&A | Investments,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q23_A_23.2,A,191,"Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider.",Negative,Fed | Central Banks,,,,,,,,

JPMorganChase_2Q23_Q_43.0,Q,211,"Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that?",Neutral,Financials,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q23_A_43.0,A,211,"Yeah. In the end, Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. We – Jamie, go ahead.",Neutral,General News | Opinion,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q23_A_43.1,A,211,"I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate products, so it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds. We're going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of our business, and not in other parts.",Negative,Financials,,,,,,,,

JPMorganChase_1Q23_Q_7.0,Q,224,"Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy.",Neutral,Macro,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q23_A_7.0,A,224,"Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.",Negative,Fed | Central Banks,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q23_Q_18.0,Q,235,"In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?",Neutral,Fed | Central Banks,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q23_A_18.0,A,235,"Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.",Negative,Fed | Central Banks,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q23_Q_19.0,Q,236,"Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color there?",Negative,Financials,Not Evasive,,,,,,,

JPMorganChase_1Q23_Q_42.0,Q,259,"Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances. And I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. And I guess, is it a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought?",Neutral,Financials,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q23_A_42.0,A,259,"Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well. So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so.",Positive,Financials,,,,,,,,

JPMorganChase_4Q22_Q_30.0,Q,291,"Let me follow up on that. So, that relates to the inorganic growth. As it relates to the organic growth, such as in the Payments business, which I know is a focus – that cuts across a lot of different business lines. So, as you invest more in Payments, which can be a 20 or 30 P/E business, which could be great if you got there – who is responsible for that sort of organic investment that cuts across? Sometimes the way you aggregate the data, it's Consumer, it's to the Investment Bank, it could be Asset Management, it could be Commercial, it could be everything in the Payments. Who's responsible for those?",Neutral,Company | Product News,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q22_A_30.0,A,291,"So, just to be clarified, so I would say that Marianne and Jenn, when it comes to credit, debit, checks, and all the consumer-related stuff. And Takis, which I think, you saw the presentation about Payments at Investor Day, reporting to Daniel, and that is on the Wholesale Payments, Merchant processing, a whole bunch of stuff. And those are direct responsibilities. It's quite clear this is an area that cuts across the company. So, there is a Payments working group that just spends time on that. That working group has not done an acquisition, okay? And if they want to invest, which there are cases by the way, and you'll see more this year, they’re decided jointly, and all the way up to Daniel and me.",Neutral,Company | Product News,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q22_Q_2.0,Q,306,"Got it. Okay. And then just the second follow-up on Jamie's points about, like, okay, if things do look worse ahead, looking ahead you might have to build a little bit more, understandable, over the next couple of years. Can you just help us understand just where you are in your scenario now as scenarios build? And just today still looks great, tomorrow there's some more uncertainty. So, how do we just get to start to understand how quickly and how you get your handle on that magnitude of ACL delta, and how do you think about it versus either, I don't know, pandemic peak or day one CECL? It's very hard for all of us to see this, of course.",Neutral,Earnings,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q22_A_2.0,A,306,"Yeah. As you know, I think CECL is an enormously bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time on it because it's not a real number. It's a hypothetical, probability-based number. I'm trying to make it very simple for you. So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up $15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that. And all it did was swing all these numbers, and it didn't change that much. Yeah, I'm trying to give you a number, but obviously this number would be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 6% and that becomes the central kind of case and then you have the possibility it gets better and possibility it gets worse, we would probably have to add something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters.",Negative,Earnings,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q22_Q_7.0,Q,311,"And just tied to that, I think the other thing that investors from the outside worry about is interconnectedness of the system, be it the UK gilts market, LBOs.

JPMorganChase_3Q22_A_7.0,A,311,"Well, I mentioned QT as being one of the uncertainties because it's a very large change in the flow of funds around the world. Who are the buyers and sellers of sovereign debt? There's a lot of sovereign debt. But I think if you look at the gilt thing alone, it’s a bump. It's not going to change what we do or how we do it, and you're going to see bumps like that, because of all the things I have already mentioned. It's inevitable that you're going to see them. Whether they create systemic risk, I don't know. I have pointed out it's harder for banks to intermediate in that, and that creates a little bit more fragility in the system. That does not mean that you're going to see a crack of some sort, but again, it's almost impossible not to have real volatility based on the facts we already told you. Those are large uncertainties that we know about today and in the future.",Negative,Markets,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q22_Q_19.0,Q,323,"Hi. Jamie, once again, I'm trying to reconcile your actions with your words. You've said publicly, you mentioned the hurricane, you mentioned a recession, you mentioned look out, and there are all sorts of risks. I don't think anyone disagrees with that. On the other hand, your reserves-to-loans are still well below CECL day one, so your actions with the reserving don't seem to reflect your more pessimistic comments about the economy. So, how do I reconcile the two?",Neutral,Earnings,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q22_A_19.0,A,323,"Yeah, so the way to do that is in our reserves today, there is a significant percentage probability that we put on adverse and severe adverse already, so it's in there already. A lot of people work in these CECL reserves, our economists, Jeremy, a lot of other folks. So, it's not set by me because I happen to think that the odds might be different than other people. But I completely understand what you're saying, but the numbers are very good. We have some of that. I'm trying to be very honest about if things get worse, here is what it might mean for reserves. That may be different because, of course, these calculations change all the time. The other thing, Michael, which is another thing, which in CECL, the timing of when something happens is very important.

JPMorganChase_3Q22_A_29.0,A,333,"No, I think I said we sell rich securities and buy cheap. So, you look at – if you look at what happened to mortgage spreads, they gapped out. They gapped in, we bought; they gapped out, we sold, and that kind of stuff, getting 2s, getting 2.5s. You could have different point of views, but – and I do expect future bond losses going forward. I just don't think that's real earnings. So, I think – but I want our people, our experts in the investment area to know if they really want to sell something, we're going to sell it. We're not going to sit here and lock ourselves into something that's gotten very, very rich because we feel like we can't take a bond loss. And remember it doesn't affect capital.

JPMorganChase_3Q22_A_38.0,A,342,"Yeah. Matt, let me take your last question first. So, in general, no, we underwrite through the cycle. We haven't – we didn't really loosen our underwriting standards in the moment where everything looked great. And so, we don't see any need to tighten now. Really, a lot of consistency there. In terms of the actual loan growth outlook, we had said for this year, obviously only one quarter left, that we'd have high-single digits. No meaningful change to that outlook there, probably a little bit of a headwind as a function of rates as you mentioned and some of the RWA optimization in mortgages. As we go into next year, we remain very positive and optimistic about the Card story across a range of dimensions in terms of both outstandings and revolver normalization. But for the rest of the loan growth environment, it's going to be, I think very dependent, especially in wholesale, on the macro situation. We know that in recessionary environments, we tend to see lower loan demand. At the same time, we've got a lot of great initiatives going and client engagement and new clients, so we'll just have to see how that plays out next year.",Positive,Financials,,,,,,,,

I don't believe you provided an update on your firm wide CET1 target of 12.5% to 13%. And given the new higher SCB, future increases in your GSIB surcharge to 4.5%, your regulatory minimum is slated to increase beyond 13% by 2024, which is also beyond the horizon reflected on slide 3. And just given that high regulatory minimum, elevated SCB volatility in recent years, what do you believe is an appropriate capital target for you to manage to from here over the long term?",Neutral,Financials,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_A_1.0,A,347,"Yeah, Steve, good question. So, obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two GSIB bucket increases coming: one in the first quarter of 2023 and the other one in the first quarter of 2024. So we had worked all that out at Investor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected would be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected, so for now, we're really focused on 1Q 2023. Of course all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5% to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher, but there is another round of SCB and that's a long way away. And as you know and as you can see, there's a lot of organic capital generation. So we'll kind of cross that bridge when we come to it.",Neutral,Financials,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_A_1.1,A,347,We intend to drive that SCB down by reducing the things that created it.,Positive,Legal | Regulation,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_Q_7.0,Q,353,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, just wondering if you could talk about the deposit trends you're seeing, the differences between commercial deposits, wealth management and retail in terms of flows and repricing pressures.",Neutral,Financials,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_A_7.0,A,353,"Yeah. Great question, John. And I think you're right to break it down by the different segments because we are seeing different dynamics there. So on the wholesale side, you do see some lower deposits, some deposit attrition, and that is entirely expected and part of the plan in the sense that, for client reasons, we had slightly higher appetite, especially in parts of the Commercial Bank, for non-operating deposits, knowing fully that our pricing strategy as rates went up was going to be not pay off. And therefore, we expected the attrition from that client base. And so we're seeing that, and that's actually something that we want, all else equal, and is playing out in line with expectations. You do see a little bit of a decline or a little bit of a headwind in Wealth Management. I think that's just seasonal tax payments being a little bit higher than usual. And then on the consumer side, we're really not seeing much at all. So that remains strong. We're not seeing any attrition there. And it's early in the cycle to really be observing much one way or the other from a pricing perspective.",Neutral,Financials,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_Q_21.0,Q,367,"Got it. Okay. That's a fair point. And then just second one on cards. Card revenue rate continues to slip even with the NII benefit. Obviously, you've got the denominator increase in there too and spend versus lend. Can you just help us understand the dynamics underneath Card revenue rate and where you expect it to go from here? Thanks.",Neutral,Earnings,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_A_21.0,A,367,"Yeah, sure. So on Card revenue rate, we'd said that we thought 10% was a reasonable number for the full year. And it's running a little bit lower right now, and I think the current level – look, what is it Mikael, 9.6% or something, is probably the right number for the full year at this point. And really the difference is driven by a couple factors. The main one is that while the growth and revolve is basically still in place, our view that we would see normalization revolve balances happening towards early – beginning of next year, that – starting point of that did get slightly delayed by Omicron, by about six weeks. And so that, all else equal, is a little bit of a NII headwind relative to what we'd expected but still obviously very robust.",Neutral,Earnings,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_A_21.1,A,367,"Can I just add a little bit on because I know I'm harping on mortgage a little bit here but I just want to explain it. Because if you go to Europe, okay, the capital held against mortgages is like a fifth of what we have to hold here. And we can obviously manage that, and standardized risk weighted assets do not represent returns or risk. So there are a lot of ways to manage it, and there's no securitization market today. So our view would change if there's a securitization market. We might do something different. But by not owning it, buying it, selling it, hedging it, swapping it, there are a million ways to manage it without really affecting a lot of your risk and returns. And so it's unfortunate, because I think this is all kind of a waste of time in terms of serving our client. Our job is to serve clients through thick or thin, good or bad, with what they need and how they need it, and now we spend all our time talking about these ridiculous regulatory requirements.",Negative,Legal | Regulation,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_A_21.2,A,367,"Right. So yeah and just to finish on Card, so slightly lower NII just from the Omicron delay and that slightly better-than-expected new client acquisition is a driver there. And then there are some subtle kind of funding effects from the higher rate environment contributing to it as well.",Neutral,Earnings,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_Q_32.0,Q,378,"Hi. Just had a few follow-up questions. The first is on balance sheet management .Jeremy, the illustrative path that you set forth on slide 3, does that include RWA mitigation? And as we think about the $58 billion-plus in updated NII guide, what kind of deposit growth does that assume? You noted that part of the SCB mitigation is to drive out non-operating deposits. Just wanted to understand what the assumption was there as well, please.",Neutral,Financials,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_A_32.0,A,378,"Yeah. Hey, Erika. Sure. So first point, you have to turn on your magnifying glass, but if you look at footnote 5 on page 3, you can see that right at the end of there, it says assumes flat RWA in the projection. And I think within that, who knows what the exact mix will be and you've heard Jamie's comments on that, but if you look at the table above, you see that you've got the usual moving parts. We've got organic loan growth that we want that's profitable on its own, or in part of important relationships that we'd like to see continue to happen. Some of it is a little bit passive. We can't really control it. It moves up and down as a function of factors like VaR. And then there's the mitigation piece of it, which we're going to turn up the scrutiny quite intensely, as I said before, on lower returning, lower client nexus, or both. So across those three bits, we'll see how it goes. But as Jamie said, we feel pretty confident here. In terms of deposits, at this point, deposit growth is probably less of a driver overall, looking forward of the NII outlook. Our deposit outlook remains more or less the same that I said before and that we've talked about at Investor Day, which is we do expect to see some attrition in wholesale. We expect consumer to be relatively stable, and we'll see how it goes.",Neutral,Financials,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_Q_33.0,Q,379,"Got it. And my follow up question is for Jamie. Jamie, we've heard your caution about the economy, and I think there's a bigger debate on how the US consumer is going to be impacted in light or in contact with the downturn. The statistics that Jeremy laid out imply a pretty healthy starting point for the consumer that you bank, and the reserve build for loan growth in Card and the less than 2% loss rate in Card lead us to believe that your consumer is still okay. As you think about the various scenarios and you think about the realistic range of outcomes, how does the US consumer perform, because it feels like that's the big wild card. And we've seen the journal term, a job flow or recession. I just wanted to get your thoughts there.",Neutral,Financials,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_A_33.0,A,379,"Yeah, so first I just want to point out that, on that chart, that's not a forecast what it's going to be at the end of the quarter. So we're going to – if you're going to pencil in some of your models, it's 12.5% on December 31 and it will probably be 13% at the end of the first quarter. And because obviously we use capital for a whole bunch of different reasons. And the consumer – I feel like a broken record. The consumer right now is in great shape. So even if we go into a recession, they're entering that recession with less leverage in far better shape than they did in 2008 and 2009 and far better shape than they did even in 2020. And jobs are plentiful. Now, of course, jobs may disappear. Things happen, so, but they're in very good shape. And obviously, when you have recessions, it affects consumer income and consumer credit. Our credit card portfolio is prime. I mean, it's exceptional. But again, we're adults in that. We know that if you have a recession loss, it will go up. We prepare for all that, and we're prepared to take it because we grow the business over time. We're not going to just immediately run out of it, and so I think it's great that the consumer's in good shape and it's excellent that – I like the fact that wages are going up for people on the low end. I like the fact that jobs are plentiful. I think that's good for the average American, and we should applaud that. And so they're in good shape right now.",Positive,Financials,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q22_Q_39.0,Q,385,"Okay. And then separately, you've got about $14 billion of losses in OCI. Obviously, most of that flows back to capital as the bonds mature. What's kind of some good rule of thumb in terms of how quickly that comes back if rates stabilize here?",Neutral,Earnings,Evasive,,,,,,,

JPMorganChase_1Q22_A_20.0,A,408,"Yeah. No. I mean, Glenn, I think, look, no one likes to be complacent about this type of stuff. And obviously, in this environment, everyone's looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to see around the corner. But as of right now, we're really not seeing anything of concern in the kind of spot metrics, so to speak.",Positive,Financials,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q22_Q_38.0,Q,426,"Okay. And then maybe just skipping over to trading, clearly a stronger quarter, must have finished off strongly in March. So any confirmation of that? And how do we – if you're expecting more volatility around Fed and QT, should we be thinking that this could be a better than normalization year? How are you thinking about trading, I guess, going forward?",Neutral,Markets,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_1Q22_A_38.0,A,426,"Yeah. I mean, you know that we're going to be reluctant to like predict the next three quarters of trading performance.",Neutral,Markets,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q21_Q_23.0,Q,456,"Fair enough, Jamie. You certainly have the track record that supports that. Just for my follow-up on card payment normalization, how are you thinking about the trajectory for card payment rates? And just maybe to speak to your confidence level that we see card payment rates return to pre-pandemic levels just given the emerging threats from BNPL that you cited and still elevated personal savings rates?",Positive,Earnings,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q21_A_23.0,A,456,"Yeah. Sure. So I still, to be honest, get a little bit confused between payment rates and revolve rates and all these various ratios, but I think it's a little bit simpler if you just take a step back. You look at the revolve rate and you look at the overall level of revolving balances and what we sort of expect for that. So there's a few things to note. So the revolve rate, having dropped quite a bit has more or less stabilized. There's a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter as a function of holiday spend and maybe some Omicron stuff, but broadly, it's stabilized. In the meantime, the growth in overall card loans has now, for several quarters in a row, produced modest growth in revolving card balances. And our central case for next year basically assumes that that trend stays in place. So what's important about that is that we're not assuming some sort of aggressive return of the revolving rate to the pre-pandemic levels. We're simply assuming that it stabilizes and that overall card loan growth, therefore, contributes its fair share of revolving loan growth. And so the kind of central case that we put on the page for the balance sheet contribution to NII growth in 2022 has, very roughly speaking, revolving balances getting back to the pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, roughly.",Neutral,Financials,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q21_Q_41.0,Q,474,"Yeah. Thank you. Just more detail on the tech spend, and what I asked before was on digital banking, you're going to the UK. What other countries are you going to? Again, just looking for some more specifics at least on digital banking and other tech areas where you expect a revenue pickup, not just – I mean, you mentioned fraud and AML and ransomware and cyber, and that's table stakes as you would say. But as far as actually getting revenue growth from your tech investments and starting off with digital banking, which new markets are you entering?",Neutral,Company | Product News,Not Evasive,,,,,,,

JPMorganChase_4Q21_A_41.4,A,474,"So, Brazil, it's not exactly the same. It's not a de novo build by us, but we're there. We're engaged. It's a significant investment, and Brazil's like a very interesting country from a consumer banking perspective. The digital play there is quite interesting. So that's one example. And obviously, we're thinking about additional places to go, and we'll let you know when we do it.",Positive,Company | Product News,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q21_Q_43.0,Q,476,"Okay. Last one. What is your total tech spend again? I thought it's on the deck. How much of that is to run the bank versus change the bank? And then as it relates to the cloud specifically, what do you expect? That was a bold move to move Chase, the core bank, to the cloud. What do you expect that to save once that gets done? Thank you.",Neutral,Company | Product News,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q21_A_43.0,A,476,"Yeah. So couple things. If you go back to my prepared remarks, so it's like $12-ish billion, a bit more, 50/50, run the bank, change the bank. And within the change agenda, half again is kind of modernization-type stuff as opposed to features and products. So it gives you a little bit of a guide.",Neutral,Company | Product News,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q21_A_43.1,A,476,"Hey, Mike. I'm going to give you one example, which may be a little helpful on this tech platform thing. I think these numbers are accurate. We did this a while ago. Card runs on mainframe, which is quite good. We have one of the most efficient, most economic, 60 million accounts, et cetera. It's been updated for years. But it's a mainframe system in the old data center. When it gets modernized to the cloud, the cost savings by running that and marginalizing it will be $30 million or $40 million a year. That isn't the reason we're doing it. The reason we're doing it is once you get that to the cloud, that the databases that it uses to feed its risk, marketing, fraud, real-time offers and stuff like that become accessible to an enormous amount of machine learning. So that you can, when Mike Mayo is going home on a Friday night, we can offer you – we know what you like to eat, eat at a steak house, you eat here, immediately offers and for stuff that is 10 times what it is today. And so that's the real value. The value isn't the immediate cost save that you've gone from – you're saving $30 million running this application here. I want the $30 million. And the other thing it allows you to do is to augment that mainframe system. When you touch a mainframe system, you've got to be a little careful when you go into it and make some modifications. So like in the old days, you used to modify that mainframe system four times a year, big releases and stuff like that, of course for multiple reasons. Now you can go in and modernize a little piece of it every week, every day. And so that's why it's so important to do this. And it's also makes it why it's hard to quantify the benefits and the costs.",Positive,Company | Product News,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q21_A_43.2,A,476,"But, Mike, just to pick one example I guess from a business that I know you know well. If you look at Teresa's Securities Services business, it's an interesting example of the way the investment relates to the strategy. So in that business, as you know, historically, winning new mandates, especially in fund services administration, tended to involve significant correlated large increases in expense as you had to onboard a lot of fund accountants. And so that was typically the dynamic there, and I think a lot of the investment that we're making there is to make that business a little bit more scalable in that respect so that when we win new business, it's a little bit more accretive. So that's kind of an interesting example of, is that tech investment that produces more revenue? I mean, I guess. I would describe it as investment that means that when we win the revenue, it's more profitable, for example. At the same time, we're also building out some really great capabilities in there in terms of data and stuff like that which maybe will help us win more mandates.",Positive,Company | Product News,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_4Q21_A_43.3,A,476,"And then we got to end this call because we've got some other stuff that we've got to do. Just for example, this is an important one, and Teresa deserves all the credit for this. We are now using JPMorgan's Investment Banking derivative capability to help clients who use derivatives for custody, to value them and stuff like that. A lot of people simply can't do that. And of course, believe it or not, a lot of portfolios now, they're using more and more what you and I would call derivatives as part of the portfolio management. That costs time, it costs money, it's on the cloud, it's hugely valuable to Teresa having a competitive advantage.",Positive,Company | Product News,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q21_Q_8.0,Q,485,"You certainly did. And just a follow up. I mean we see the results, the marginal efficiency in the businesses where you're growing has improved, and we just don't have the why. So how much of that is tech-driven versus other reasons? I mean I guess you have metrics internally that we just don't have. But your marginal efficiency is what? Or your unit costs are going down. Or any additional color as to the why the marginal efficiency is improving?",Neutral,Company | Product News,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q21_A_8.0,A,485,"Yeah. So, I mean, I think reasonable people can differ on how you talk about this stuff, especially in terms of what parts of the expense base you see as a little bit more fixed versus a little bit more floating. I would have said that in reality, marginal expense increases as a function of most types of marginal revenue are actually lower than a lot of people think. So the sort of operating leverage that you see, especially in the type of environment that we've had with really big increases in revenue in the capital markets areas and the NIR side, is actually relatively consistent with what I would have expected. But a little bit to your point, Mike, what is also true is that we're a big organization. There's a scale play here. We have a big fixed cost base. And a lot of the modernization agenda is about making sure that that doesn't creep and that it's as expensive as possible so that it can be as nimble as possible and that marginal efficiency over time is as good as possible. But that's a long play there.",Neutral,Earnings,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q21_A_8.1,A,485,"Let me just add, Mike, one of the things you think about, one is people worried about the forecast for next year and stuff like that. We're playing the game for 10 years here. So we're going – and we're not going to disclose certain things like margin by product or stuff like that because it's competitive information. But the long game, we are competing with some very large talented global players. We're not even in banking today. And we are going to compete in that. So even some of these acquisitions are more around that than around just what I consider traditional banking. And so and in my whole life, just so you know, we've been modernizing technology. Every year, of every month, of every quarter that's like a permanent state of affairs. Obviously, now it's to the cloud and stuff like that. Those things are critical to do to be competitive going forward. That was true, by the way, 20 years ago.",Positive,M&A | Investments,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q21_Q_23.0,Q,500,"Got it. Yeah. And I was just wondering if there'll be increased scrutiny of the nonbank players relative to the banks but point noted. And I guess just on a separate question, Jeremy, we didn't see any build in the CET1 when I look at the numerator. Anything going on there this quarter that impacted it and with the stock rate is at 2.4 times tangible book, just remind us how important are buybacks here as opposed to just keeping some dry powder as the economy gets better?",Neutral,Financials,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q21_A_23.0,A,500,"Yeah. So I mean the answer to how important buybacks are is that they're at the end of our capital hierarchy as we often say, right? So organic growth, including acquisitions, sustainable dividend, and only then do we look at buybacks. And in light of the SCB environment that we're in where we don't have a Fed-approved buyback plan anymore and if we just simply have to comply with the minimums in BAU that gives us quite a bit of nimbleness which is an important thing to preserve in light of a world where we do hope for loan growth next year and where acquisitions are still potentially on the horizon. So nothing really going on this quarter other than the little bit of RWA growth in the denominator, and we're just really going to stay nimble there.",Neutral,Financials,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q21_Q_37.0,Q,514,"Yes. Good morning. I wanted to sort of get a progress report on your new headquarter building. Specifically, what's the projected move-in date? Or has that been affected by the pandemic? Secondly, are there costs, noticeable costs running through 2021 expense structured for that build-out? And does that tick up noticeably when you move in? And then thirdly, what's the plan for unloading the properties that you'll be vacating? And how has that been affected by the current real estate market? Thank you.",Neutral,Company | Product News,Not Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q21_A_37.0,A,514,"So the plan is on schedule. Move-in date, I think, 2025.

Operator, any other questions?",Neutral,Company | Product News,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q21_Q_39.0,Q,516,"Okay. That's great. So it seems like you're taking a benign view that it's manageable. It's not going to get out of hand, it's fair enough.",Neutral,Macro,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_3Q21_A_39.0,A,516,"No. It's the opposite. I'm telling you I don't – it's the opposite. I'm telling you I don't know. We're prepared for all eventualities. There may be a fat tail of inflation. And one of the things about our balance sheet, and you guys talk about liquidity and stuff like that, one of the fat tails that a bank should be worried about is high inflation and high rates. And being very liquid protects us more against that than other things.",Positive,Macro,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_Q_4.0,Q,521,"Okay. And just one quickie on the recent both acquisitions and investments. And you or Jamie could feel free to take it. I'm curious on, A, big picture. Is it just coincidence that there have been five things in a very short period of time? And maybe if you want to expand on maybe Nutmeg specifically and why the change in terms of shying away from international expansion in the past and now making a little bit better move in. I appreciate it. Thanks.",Neutral,M&A | Investments,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_A_4.0,A,521,"Sure, Glenn. So, let me start with the international expansion point on the Consumer side, because that's interesting. You've heard Jamie over the years talk about why it wouldn't really make sense to do international expansion in Consumer when you think about that through the lens of a branch-based strategy. So, if you imagine going outside of the US and opening branches in other countries and competing with the incumbents, just from a branding perspective, from an operating leverage perspective, we've never felt that that was likely to be a successful strategy for us. And that hasn't really changed. The difference right now is the ability to do that digitally. So, what's really particularly exciting about the international expansion narrative both in the UK and now with our recent investment in C6 in Brazil is the ability to kind of experiment a little bit. Obviously, it's a strategically compelling opportunity. Brazil, as you probably know, is like the third biggest consumer banking market in the world. But it's kind of fun to be the disruptor. And so I think, for us, given our position in Consumer Banking in the United States, being in a place where we are actually the outsider disrupting through these kind of digital channels, we see it among other things, in addition to being compelling financially, as a really good opportunity to learn and to challenge ourselves a little bit from the inside. So, we're quite excited about that stuff.",Positive,M&A | Investments,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_Q_24.0,Q,541,"Okay. For my follow-up, Jeremy, I just wanted to ask or at least hone in on one comment you made where you said you could potentially still manage to a 12% capital target. I was just trying to better understand how much capital cushion you are looking to manage to under the SCB. And if the G-SIB surcharge is not recalibrated, where do you think you'll have to run on a steady-state basis? Just because it feels like waiting for Godot, we haven't seen any changes on the recalibration front, specifically with the G-SIB surcharge.",Negative,Legal | Regulation,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_A_24.0,A,541,"Yeah, okay. So, basically that's a question about the management buffer and a question about what we would do in a world where G-SIB doesn't get recalibrated. And a world where G-SIB doesn't get recalibrated is a world where our capital minimums are quite a bit higher starting in 2023. We, obviously, disagree with that. We don't think it makes any sense at all, given that a big part of the driver of that increase in the amount of capital that we would have, and as Jamie pointed out earlier, both we and the system are really flush with capital and the regulators have been pretty clear that there's enough capital in the system right now. And that growth would increase that amount quite a bit for us and for everyone else. So, that's a big part of the reason why we've been so vocal for so long about the need to recalibrate that. And I think we see some of our competitors making those points too as they start to creep up into higher buckets. And to be fair, the Fed has acknowledged that this is a thing that needs to get fixed. It's just that they're kind of busy trying to get the Basel III endgame put in place in the US rules, which brings particular complexities in light of the columns floor.",Neutral,Legal | Regulation,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_A_24.1,A,541,"Can I just add to this? I have always felt the G-SIFI calculation is one of the stupidest I've ever seen in my whole life, and then we doubled it here. So, the European banks have a lot of disadvantages in terms of they don’t have a common regulator. They can't expand across Europe. But one of the advantages, they have pretty much half the G-SIFI, and I just don't think that in the long run that's right for America to be doubling, and – what I would consider basing artificial numbers. And so, let's just wait and see what the new rules are, and then we'll answer that question. We don't have to sit there and guess what's going to happen.",Negative,Legal | Regulation,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_A_24.2,A,541,"Yeah. And I think, Steve, the important point is that in the near term, we're actually bound by leverage. So, that's what we're focused on right now. That's our biggest single thing that we'd like to see fixed, because that is affecting the management of the balance sheet right now in ways that we think really don't make sense and, eventually, result in higher costs that will get passed on into the real economy. Just to touch on your buffer point briefly. When all is said and done, and the framework is fully settled, hopefully, we're back to being bound by risk-based constraints, we have a bit more experience with a couple of years of SCB, and there's a little bit less rule uncertainty. It would be – there's an interesting conversation to have about what the right management buffers are for people in a world where we do think it's important and we've made these points to destigmatize the use of buffers. We've made this point in the context, for example, of the money market complex too. We have all these kinds of guidelines, and the rules have them as buffers that you are supposedly free to use, but that's not the way everyone treats them. So, buffers become minimums and that adds a brittleness to the system that makes it more pro-cyclical than anyone wants it to be. So, down the road when things are stable, the buffer discussion could become interesting, but right now, it's a somewhat simpler story and it's really about SLR.",Negative,Legal | Regulation,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_A_24.3,A,541,"And remember, there's one buffer we don't really talk about, which is $40 billion of pre-tax earnings a year. Okay? That's a huge buffer. It's huge that allows you to change your forward-looking capital if you buy back stock or don't buy back stock. And so, we have a lot of leverage, and whatever happens, we're going to figure out a way to do a great job for shareholders.",Positive,Earnings,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_Q_37.0,Q,554,"You know it's interesting versus when you were at our conference, Jamie, it seems like the $52.5 billion is more a function of the curve, given the fact that Card did, it looks like, better than you had thought at that time in the middle of June based on your comments about spend being up so much. But the...",Positive,Earnings,Evasive,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_A_37.0,A,554,"Betsy, let me just – sorry to interrupt you, but let me just pick up on that point for a second, because I think someone else asked a similar question. But I would just remind you that we do see the very healthy sequential growth in Card loans on the back of spending. But the key issue is the revolve behavior. And so our view on that really hasn't changed. And we do see elevated pay rates as a result of the cash buffers, which remains kind of the consistent reason why we have a muted outlook for Card NII this year.",Neutral,Earnings,,,,,,,,
JPMorganChase_2Q21_A_37.1,A,554,"And I don't want to correct anyone here, but I personally think you'll see it go up by the end of the year. Okay? I think we're conservative on that, because with all the spend and stuff like that. But we hate guessing. What I'd look at much more is how many cards you have, how much spend you have, how many happy customers do you have. NII will take care of itself.",Positive,Earnings,,,,,,,,
